# code-defintions

This repo is no longer worked on. I have decided to move definition files as an embeded file in the ModelHelper CLI instead of relying on an external file.

In a future version I might change my mind and use external definition file or a combination of embedded and external.

In this project you will find definistions for various languages to be used in a modelhelper setup.

Download the files from the latest release or clone/fork the project and update the location in the modelhelper config with this command

```bash
mh set lang <the 'definitions' folder>
``` 

or

```bash
cd <the 'definitions' folder>
mh set lang
```
